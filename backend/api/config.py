This file holds Configuration options. The Development config looks for a creds.ini file or defaults to the normal url. 
DockerDevConfig is used when the env variable FLASK_ENV=docker, which is currently used in Dockerfile-dev and thus,
docker-compose. Production is used in Heroku as well as Zeit now. You may change these however you want.

DO NOT HARD CODE YOUR PRODUCTION URLS EVER. Either use creds.ini or use environment variables.
